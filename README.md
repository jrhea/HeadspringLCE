HeadspringLCE - Employee Directory
=============

Summary:
==

This is a corporate employee directory.  It features: MVC + SOA architecture, role-based security, simple UI for CRUD operations and is designed to run on a corporate intranet.

Goal:
==

Rather than focusing all my energy on creating a simple flashy looking web app, I tried to incorportate as many skills/technologies in this project as time permitted. My idea was that it would showcase my ability to do more than tweak html and css.

Technologies Used:
==

-Net Framework 4.5.1 with Visual Studio 2013 Express (It was PAINFUL not having the full version).
-MVC pattern
-SOA using a WCF services.
-Use of ORM with Entity Framework 6
-Dot Net Reflection to minimize code maintenance points.
-Simple Role-Based security
-Unit tests
-Use of css and boostrapper framework to customize the look of the ASP.Net MVC web app.
-Used XML style documentation with Doxygen and Microsoft's HTML Help Workshop to create .chm documentation file.
-Build script to build the project from the cmd line and run unit tests (useful with Continuous Integration).

Shortcomings:
==

There are plenty given the limited time my schedule (wife and kids) allowed me to work on it this weeked.  ;) That being said, I think you will see a little bit of what I can do.  Specifically, I really wanted to showoff the Pub-Sub pattern with WCF and show how to use callbacks to create live updating web apps.


Project Documentation:
==

Yes there is more than just this README.  Look in ./Documentation for EmployeeDirectory.chm.  This compiled help file contains all documentation for the project.
